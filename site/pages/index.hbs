								Technology is having a profound impact on how businesses operate and win, serve and retain customers.  Digital, mobile, cloud, sensors and more are fundamentally changing how enterprises operate. Technology enables new business models. It also creates experiences that are much more intuitive, proactive and relevant to consumers. For example, allowing customers to open a hotel door with a mobile app may seem straightforward, but there is ripple effect through processes, infrastructure, talent and more … including security. This session will explore both the trends and key drivers of digital business transformations as well as highlight the impact on security.
