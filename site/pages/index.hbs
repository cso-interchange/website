				<p>As companies embrace technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data, cloud, and mobility, security must be more than an afterthought. But in the digital era, the focus needs to shift from securing network perimeters to safeguarding data spread across systems, devices, and the cloud. </p>

				<p><b class="invitation-only">CIO/CISO Interchange is an invitation-only forum to discuss ideas and trends concerning all C-level roles. There are no product pitches and no sales personnel, just candid talk on important security issues facing you and your peers. </b></p>

				<p>CIO/CISO Interchange is sponsored by the Qualys Community for discussions, debates and exchanges on line. It is a non-profit, non-commercial organization, founded by Philippe Courtot, Chairman & CEO, Qualys, Inc.</p>
